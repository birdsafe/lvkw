# LVKW TestBed

The goal of this project is to create a single application that makes use of every. single. feature. of [https://github.com/birdsafe/lvkw](lvkw).

You can use as either a working code example of the library, or as a debugging tool to better understand how it behaves under various conditions.

For now, it's just a bare-bones IMGUI hookup.
